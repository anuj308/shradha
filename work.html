          <h1>CBR Project Overview:</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
          This is a Community Based Rehabilitation Programme Implemented By SHRADHA and
          Supported by <b> Tata Power Western Odisha Distribution Limited (TPWODL) </b> in
          collaboration with govt. of Odisha in 9 Gram Panchayat’s of Bisra Block i.e (Bisra,
          Bondamunda, Jhirpani, Jamsera, Dareikela,Kapatmunda, Manko,Santoshpur&amp;Udusu).,
          under which we are covering total 43 villagers. We have reached to 855 PwDs from four
          GPs out of which 283 female and 572 Male. Expecting to reach up to 1200 PwDs from
          these five new G.Ps. The purpose of this project is to establish a Community-Based
          Rehabilitation (CBR) system aimed at improving the lives of differently abled person’s within
          their community. The main objective of the project is to provide the PwDs their equal rights
          and opportunities to bring them to the mainstreaming of the society. The program will focus
          on providing comprehensive support, training, and resources to enhance their physical,
          social, and emotional well-being. By involving the community and fostering inclusivity, this
          project aims to create an environment where disabled individuals can grow and develop well.
          In order to achieve the above said objectives we are undertaking some activities in the field
          like identification of unreached PwDs through household Survey, Awareness programmes on
          the rights of differently abled persons &amp; Govt. schemes meant for them, opening of 4
          counselling, vocational training and rehabilitation centres with the help of GP sarpanch and
          local stakeholders and community and provide vocational trainings to make the illegible
          PwDs became self independent and self depended. Provide therapy to the PwDs for their
          physical rehabilitation, linkages with Govt. as well as Private stakeholder for the betterment
          of Differently abled person. Providing handholding support to the PwDs in accessing the
          Govt. Services.</p>
<br>
          <p>124 PwDs trained in Vocational training like paper bag, phenyl and candle making out of
            which 57 female and 67 male. 16 people are taking physiotherapy sessions. These are the
            activities going on in the respected GPs. In future we are planning to form PwDs SHGs
            through which they can get financial support from banks to start their work.</p>
